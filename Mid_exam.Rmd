## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#libary some functions
library(dplyr) 
library(table1)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
#import the cvs dataset
titanic_ds<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kijohnson/Data/main/titanic.csv")
```
```{r}
#install the doBy function
install.packages("doBy")
```

```{r}
#use doBy function to calculate the median age by passengers class
library(doBy)
summaryBy(Age ~ Pclass, data = titanic_ds, 
          FUN = list(median))
```
```{r}
#change Pclass to factor variable
titanic_ds$Pclass <- as.factor(titanic_ds$Pclass)
```


```{r}
#make a boxpolt and violin plot to show medians, spread of data, and outliers
ggplot(data = titanic_ds, aes(x = Pclass, y = Age)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Passenger class", y = "Age",  title = "Boxplot and Violin plot")
```
```{r}

```
